# Adaptive-Rock-Paper-Scissors-using-Iocaine-Powder
A rock-paper-scissor (RPS) web based game I developed for my grad school project. It utilizes 'Iocaine Powder' - a heuristic based (RPS) algorithm developed by Dan Egnor in 1999 as its core.

Iocaine Powder was developed to compete in Darse Billings' First International RoShamBo Programming Competition in 1999 at the University of Alberta. It was competing against other algorithms (bot vs bot) and never formally against humans. Iocaine Powder won all 25 tournaments and was considered by Billings as "...a generation ahead of its time.".

Aside from fulfilling my course requirements, this project has been a great means to expand my knowledge in programming, web development and was my first time working with React, Vite and Flask.
